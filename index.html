		<div>CCCT recognises two aspects of discipline, namely, the corrective and the punitive. The former involves mainly counselling, and the latter involves some form of punitive action. All Heads of Departments are primarily responsible for maintaining strict discipline in their departments. If there is any breach of discipline it is the department head who should, in the first instance, investigate the matter and take appropriate action.</div>
		<div>Procedure</div>
		<div>Disciplinary Acion

a) The College may decide to take disciplinary action against an employee for misconduct that could lead to disciplinary action. Although it is not possible to state the nature of all circumstances, some examples of the types of offences are: -

  • Repeated absence without permission
  • Repeated late arrival for work
  • Inappropriate behaviours during working hours which is damaging to the
    College reputation
  • Discourtesy to employers, peers, customers or students
  • Profane or abusive language

b) The HOD will deal with minor breaches of discipline, which can be resolved with a reprimand or verbal.

c) If there has been an act of misconduct or breach of discipline, which is likely to result in a disciplinary action more serious than a verbal warning, the HOD would consult the HR Department. The HOD could issue a warning letter to the offender if found necessary to do so after the initial investigation. A copy of the warning letter endorsed by the offender should go to HR Department for filing in the personal file.

d) CCCT will terminate any employee after the third warning letter is issued and no improvements to the employee’s performance or conduct. CCCT have the right to terminate employee either immediately or with specified period notice.</div>
		<div>Resignations

Policy

An intention to resign or retire must be communicated to the HOD in writing.

Procedure

Notice

a) The Employee must give the correct notice period as stated in the Contract of Employment.

b) The Employee shall submit his/her resignation letter to the HOD and copy the written notice to the HR department.

c) On receiving the copy of the written notice, the HR will formally acknowledge the notice and commence finalising remuneration arrangements and ensure that all salary, leave balance and other entitlements are settled.</div>
		<div>Dress Code Policy</div>
		<div>Finger Print Attendance

a) All employees are required to register their attendance by finger print through the HCM8 system. All employees are expected to observe the hours of work established by the college. The HRIS will record their daily attendance and it is a system for staff to apply for leave.

b) If the employee is going to be late or absent from work, he/she shall make every attempt to notify his/her HOD so that he/she arrange a replacement to cover the employee duties / responsibilities during his/her absence.

c) If the machine is not functioning due to some technical failure, the employees should inform to HR Department by email immediately or latest by three (3) days. Any more than that will not be considered.</div>
		<div>Attendance / Hours of work</div>
		<div>Let’s Start the Quiz</div>
		<div>Working Days and Hours

a) Each HOD is responsible to report to the HR Department if an employee fail to report to work. An employee must not be absent from duty without proper authority and therefore must notify their supervisors in the event of an emergency.

b) Employees failing to report to work without informing their HOD will have the period of absence treated as absent without official leave resulting in disciplinary action including dismissal.

c) The employee must not leave his or her place of work during working hours without the permission of his or her HOD.

d) Complying with working hours and maintaining a good attendance record are necessary so that the college can plan and conduct its business with minimum disruption.
